    <string name="game_instructions">\n**A player may move by touching green squares only.\n**A menu will pop-up when items are found in a room. Select check boxes to pick them up. 
                  \n**When a monster is nearby a notification will appear on the screen. If you have picked up a weapon it is automatically armed and the monster will die. If you are not 
                  armed with a weapon you still have a chance to kill a monster if your attack power level is high enough, but it wont be easy.\n**When your energy level reaches 0 you will die.
                  If you have remaining lives you will get to start the game over to try again. Good luck!</string>
