Project 2d Steps

1. Run the Walker App on your emulator or Android device.
2. When you reach the main screen, input a Player name over 5 characters long, on the line that defaults to the Player name 'Walker'. This length is necessary as a key has to be a minimum of 5 characters in length.
3. Select the other configurable options like lives, energy, etc.
3. When you are done, click the top button labeled "OpenKeyVal"
4. Clicking the 'Post' button will push the Player attributes you selected on the previous screen, to Openkeyval web service. You should see a 'Post Successful!' message display on the screen.
5. Open a web browser and type in the following url:  api.openkeyval.org/playername   
where playername = the same name you entered in the app
6. A webpage should now display the same player attributes and player name you inputted on the main menu screen of the Walker app
